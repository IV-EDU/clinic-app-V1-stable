All project-specific rules for agents are defined in `AGENTS.md` at the project root.

When working in this repository:
- Read `AGENTS.md` first and follow it strictly.
- `AGENTS.md` will tell you when to consult other files such as `LAST_PLAN.md`, `plan_Agents.md`, `docs/INDEX.md`, and `README.md`.

This file is intentionally minimal to avoid conflicting instructions.
